## Day 7

Day 7 and while this week was good warm up. I think the new goal will be to make one GOOD web site a week. I will plan and make a design and then code it out. I have found that making a new website from scratch with no plan everyday has proven to be difficult and not what I should be training. So it should be early in the week I will plan with fonts and colors and spacing then the last part of the week will be making the design a website.
